        <h1>Personal Site Plan</h1>

        <p>In their free time, lots of people like to play video games.  But what I like to do in my free time is make video games.  Of course, I'm still learning quite a lot, so I have nothing finished to share, but with a growing community of indie game developers, it's good to be able to look at the progress and methods of other game developers for inspiration or support.  That's why I'm building this website; to share the progress I make in my journey towards being a full-time indie game developer.</p>
        <p>This website will be useful as a portfolio to potential employers, but also to fans of the game development industry and anyone who might like to make their own games</p>

        <h2 class="intro-question">About This Website</h2>
        <p class="intro">This generation is full of the delightful interactive simulations we call video games.  Every few months or so, people around the world can expect the release of a big new game, and it's all thanks to people with a passion to make those games.  As a game developer myself, I made this website to share this passion and show my progress.  Every week there will be a new update on how far I've come and important things that I have learned, accompanied with images and details of how I did it.</p>
