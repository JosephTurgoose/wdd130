        <h1>Personal Site Plan</h1>

        <p>In their free time, lots of people like to play video games.  But what I like to do in my free time is make video games.  Of course, I'm still learning quite a lot, so I have nothing finished to share, but with a growing community of indie game developers, it's good to be able to look at the progress and methods of other game developers for inspiration or support.  That's why I'm building this website; to share the progress I make in my journey towards being a full-time indie game developer.</p>
        <p>This website will be useful as a portfolio to potential employers, but also to fans of the game development industry and anyone who might like to make their own games</p>
