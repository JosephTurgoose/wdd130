    <p>You are the golden knight of ages.  After awaking from an absurdly  long magical slumber, you must relocate your magical equipment and find your way back to your home town of Faraburra to save it's people from utter destruction by the hands of Gallamal, a dark sorcerer intent on displaying his "ultimate power."</p>
    <p>Game originally designed by myself with Construct 3.</p>
    <p>Currently Working on: Converting progress from Construct 3 to Unity engine.</p>
    <p>Upcoming plans: Add "Spark;" a magical effect.  Rearrange UI.  Rescale game.  Increase map size and depth.  Fix enemy spawn locations.</p>
    <p>Further Details about the Golden Knight to come.</p>
