    <p1 class="resources-introduction">If you want to make your own games, or you just want to see where I've gone for learning, this is the right place to be.  YouTube videos, asset store links, and many more will be posted here as I use them.  I also have a rough guide for which game engine may be right for you.  I have worked with and love 3 unique game engines: Construct 3, Unreal Engine, and Unity, so I've listed some of the best and worst qualities I have noticed as I have used them.</p1>

    <!-- <h1>Game Engines</h1>
    <p1>Game engines are what game developers use to create their games.  I have worked with and love 3 unique game engines: Construct 3, Unreal Engine, and Unity.</p1> -->

    <h2 class="construct-title">Construct 3</h2>
    <img alt="construct" src="images/Construct 3.png" class="construct">
    <p class="construct-intro">Construct 3 is a relatively new game engine optimized for the creation of 2-dimensional games.  It is perfect for anyone who is learning the fundamentals of game-development, or anyone dedicated to a 2D game or project they want to create.</p1>
    <p class="construct-upsides">Upsides: Construct 3 is simple to learn and ever-growing, making it great for beginners just coming to understand how to fit pieces of a game together.</p1>
    <p class="construct-downsides">Downsides: Construct 3 is a subscription-based game-engine, meaning almost nothing can be done in Construct without paying money.  It is also somewhat limited in complex capabilities and organization due to its relative newness.</p2>

    <h2 class="unreal-title">Unreal Engine 4 and 5</h2>
    <img alt="unreal" src="images/unreal-engine.png" class="unreal">
    <p class="unreal-intro">Unreal Engine has made some of the most popular games today.  Widely known for it's immense 3D capabilities, Unreal Engine is one of the leading engines in the world for video game production.</p1>
    <p class="unreal-upsides">Upsides: Numerous in-depth tutorials for both beginners and experts, active community, monthly free assets, free to use, relatively beginner-friendly.</p1>
    <p class="unreal-downsides">Downsides: Learning the coding system from a beginner point can be difficult and large unique projects require time and knowledge of other programs.</p1>
    <p class="unreal-link">Link: https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/</p1>

    <h2 class="unity-title">Unity Engine</h2>
    <img alt="unity" src="images/unity.png" class="unity">
    <p class="unity-intro">Unity is a widely-known free game engine with both 2D and 3D capabilities, although it is most known for its 2D capabilities.  In my opinion, this is the 2D Unreal Engine.</p1>
    <p class="unity-upsides">Upsides: Easy to learn the basics, supports multiple coding language (though mainly C#), great variety in capabilities, free to use, occasional free assets.</p1>
    <p class="unity-downsides">Downsides: Somewhat buggy in places, file corruption issues, somewhat limited 3D capabilities, less beginner support than Unreal Engine.</p1>
