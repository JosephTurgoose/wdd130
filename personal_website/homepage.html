    <p class="homepage-intro">In their free time, lots of people like to play video games. But what I like to do in my free time is make video games. Of course, I'm still learning quite a lot, so I have nothing finished to share, but with a growing community of indie game developers, it's good to be able to look at the progress and methods of other game developers for inspiration or support. That's why I'm building this website; to share the progress I make in my journey towards being a full-time indie game developer.</p1>
    <p class="homepage-intro-2">If you're wondering exactly what you can find on this website, look no further.  Here is a detailed list of everything you can currently find on this website, as well as everything that is coming to this website in the future:</p1>

    <div class="list-of-content">
        <h3 class="homepage-currently-available">Currently Available:</h3>
        <h2 class="resources-details">Resources Page</h2>
        <p class="resources-explanation">The whole point of this website is sharing progress and inspiration.  That's hard to do when there's no way to see the stones I have stepped on over my time learning game development.  On this resources page I will be posting many of the tools I have found most useful in getting to this point.  This will include links to learning videos that I have found value in studying, links to the various game engines I have learned to use, online stores for free assets, and more.</p1>
        <h2 class="projects-details">Projects Page</h2>
        <p class="projects-explanation">Of course, another essential part of building a portfolio is sharing the work you have completed.  That is why I will upload biweekly posts on this page.  This will help to keep track of how far I have come and in how much time.  Additionally, there will be a section for notes and a checklist regarding things that I am currently working on and plan to do in the future.</p1>
        <h3 class="homepage-coming-up">Soon to Come</h3>
        <p class="coming-up">To be updated; More information will come as I begin work on more pages for this website.</p1>
